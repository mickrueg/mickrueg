### Hello 👋

I have a knack for building clean web applications and my peers would describe me as a self-starter, strong communicator, and average rock climber.

I build in React, CSS, JavaScript, Google Apps Script, and more. Check out my [portfolio site](https://mikekrueger.netlify.app/) to see the magic.
