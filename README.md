### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I have a knack for building clean web applications and my peers would describe me as a self-starter, strong communicator, and average rock climber.

I build in React, CSS, JavaScript, Google Apps Script, and more. Check out my [recent projects here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekrueger1/details/projects/).
